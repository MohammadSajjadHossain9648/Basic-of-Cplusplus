    LCM(a, b) = (a * b)/GCD(a, b);

    The steps to calculate the LCM of (a, b) using the GCD method is:
    Step 1: Find the product of a and b.
    Step 2: Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a and b.
    Step 3: Divide the values obtained in Step 1 and Step 2.
    Step 4: The obtained value after division is the greatest common divisor of (a, b).

    how count GCD in mathmatically?
    Example: Find the GCF (18, 27):
    The prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3 = 18.
    The prime factorization of 27 is 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.

    The occurrences of common prime factors of 18 and 27 are 3 and 3.
    So the greatest common factor of 18 and 27 is 3 x 3 = 9.

    Example: Find the GCF (20, 50, 120):
    The prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 5 = 20.
    The prime factorization of 50 is 2 x 5 x 5 = 50.
    The prime factorization of 120 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 = 120.

    The occurrences of common prime factors of 20, 50 and 120 are 2 and 5.
    So the greatest common factor of 20, 50 and 120 is 2 x 5 = 10.


    Example: Find the greatest common divisor of 15 and 70 using the GCD method.
    Solution: The Least Common Multiple of 15 and 70 can be calculated as:

    The product of 10000 and 228 is given as, 10000 * 228 = 2280000
    The GCD of (10000, 228) is 4.
    LCM(10000, 228) = product of (10000, 228)/ GCD of (10000, 228) = 570000.

    âˆ´ The greatest common divisor of (10000, 228) is 4.

    /*how it works in code?
    a = 105 , b = 30
    gcd(b, a%b): gcd(30, 15)

    a = 30 , b = 15
    gcd(b, a%b): gcd(15, 0)

    a = 15 , b = 0

    lcm = 105*30/gcd(105,30) = 105*30/15 = 210
